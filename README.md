# STL-C++ Algorithms

Very Short and Concise explanation of all the STL Algorithms in C++. you can use them to solve the competititve coding problems because these algorithms makes the task 
to be easier and also break down the complexitites of big problem in linear time.

you must need to only hand-on these algorithms before directly implementing to contest..
